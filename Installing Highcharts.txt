To set up high charts, which is what I used to chart the average temperature for a period of time. FIrst I downloaded the packages containing essential information for forming the graphs. The packages were in a zip file on my personal desktop. So I unzipped the file. Then on the command line I sent the files from my computer to the pi:

	sch -rv js pi@24.161.98.162:Documents

This put it in my documents. Then packages needed to be in the same directory as the webpage that is accessing it so I moved the files by:

	sudo mv js /var/www

Now the packages are accessible for the web browser. From there I created the graph vectors to pull from the database:

$dbh = new PDO('sqlite:project.db');
                $result = $dbh->query('SELECT * FROM current');
                $i = 0;
                foreach($result as $row)
                {
                
                        if(empty($row['temp']))
{       
}
                        else{           
                        if($i<150)
{$i =$i +1;}
else
{
                                $result_temp[] = $row['temp'];
                                $result_time[] = $i-150;
                                $i = $i + 1;
                                }
}                            
           }

           }
        catch(PDOException $e) {
                echo $e->getMessage();
           }
?>

        $(function () {
 $('#container').highcharts({
            title: {
                text: 'Average Temperature',
                x: -20 
            },
            subtitle: {
                text: ' ',
                x: -20
            },
            xAxis: {
                categories: [<?php echo join($result_time, ',') ?>]
            },
            yAxis: {
                title: {
                    text: 'Temperature (\xB0F)'
 },
                plotLines: [{
                    value: 0,
                    width: 1,
                    color: '#FFFF00'
                }]
            },
            tooltip: {
                valueSuffix: '\xB0F'
            },
            series: [{
                name: 'Temperature',
                data: [<?php echo join($result_temp, ',') ?>]
            }]
        });
});
    

                </script>

This was in the header file so everything is done on load. To draw the chart, commands 

	<script src="../../js/highcharts.js"></script>
	<script src="../../js/modules/exporting.js"></script>

	<div id="container" style="min-width: 310px; height: 400px; margin: 0 auto"></div>

was added at the end of the body so graph is on bottom of page.
