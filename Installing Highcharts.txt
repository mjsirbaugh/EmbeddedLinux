To set up high charts, which is what I used to chart the average temperature for a period of time. FIrst I downloaded the packages containing essential information for forming the graphs. The packages were in a zip file on my personal desktop. So I unzipped the file. Then on the command line I sent the files from my computer to the pi:

	sch -rv js pi@24.161.98.162:Documents

This put it in my documents. Then packages needed to be in the same directory as the webpage that is accessing it so I moved the files by:

	sudo mv js /var/www

Now the packages are accessible for the web browser.
